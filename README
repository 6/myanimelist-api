MyAnimeList Unofficial API
==========================

An unofficial API for the awesome http://myanimelist.net/.

Why?
----
There're no official plans by MyAnimeList to release an official API yet. I
intend to use this API to build other apps.

What do I need to run this?
---------------------------
* ruby 1.8.6 or later.
* rubygems.
* Curb. Get chuyeow's fork at http://github.com/chuyeow/curb/tree/master until
  a bug has been patched in Curb. You'll need libcurl to get this gem installed.
* Sintara. See http://www.sinatrarb.com/.
